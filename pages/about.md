Current AI systems -- the ones you see everyday in the news -- have a number of known problems. They are prone to 'hallucination', a mathematical glitch that makes them invent facts out thin air, and they pollute: the largest architectures generate the yearly CO2 emissions of hundreds of households in just one round of 'training'. There are regular reports of professionals unknowingly misusing the technology, resulting in lawsuits, privacy breaches, and decision-making errors.

Whether you are a business, a government organisation or a community project, we believe that you should get the benefits of AI without the risks. The information you collect for yourself and your customers should be accurate. You should not have to worry about compromising your privacy. You should be able to run intelligent systems without high energy costs or unnecessary emissions. 

This is why we care about developing small AI agents that fit your specific use case and that you can run in-house, keeping full control over your data and processes. Our in-house expertise comes from 17 years of academic research dedicated to make computer systems learn more from less data.
